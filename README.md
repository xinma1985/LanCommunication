# Introduction 
LanCommunication is a local area network (LAN) communication application that runs on Android phones.

# Details
After the master phone creates a hotspot and the slave phone connects to it, they send information to a fixed port via UDP broadcast. The master and slave phones can then communicate after obtaining each other's IP addresses.  
The phone that creates the hotspot acts as a slave device and another phone that connects to the hotspot act as a master phone.  
One team only has one master phone and multiply slave phones.
